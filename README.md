# magic-string: Julia-style non-standard string literals

This is a work in progress.  So far, `readtable.rkt` works fine, although the lookahead parsing could perhaps be rewritten at a higher level.  Although this is technical usable now, there are several aspects of a `#lang` I have yet to learn, such as the DrRacket integration.  I'll continue to work on this as I learn!
